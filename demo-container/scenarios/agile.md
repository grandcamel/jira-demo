# Agile & Sprint Management Scenario

This walkthrough demonstrates sprint planning and backlog management.

## Step 1: View the Backlog

```
Show me the backlog for project DEMO
```

This displays unassigned issues not in any sprint.

## Step 2: View Current Sprint

```
What's in the current sprint for DEMO?
```

You should see the "Demo Sprint" with its issues.

## Step 3: Check Sprint Progress

```
